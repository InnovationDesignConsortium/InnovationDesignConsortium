# **Documentation Standards** `✏️`

Clear, concise, and consistent documentation is a cornerstone of collaborative projects, especially within a consortium of Architecture and Engineering firms. Proper documentation ensures that everyone, from stakeholders to developers, has a clear understanding of the project's goals, procedures, and outcomes.

## **Why Documentation Matters**

Good documentation:
- **Clarifies Complex Concepts**: Particularly in AEC, where projects can be technically intricate.
- **Facilitates Collaboration**: Allows members from various firms to understand and contribute effectively.
- **Serves as a Historical Record**: Helps new members catch up and understand the progression of projects.

## **Our Guidelines**

### **1. Structure & Format**

- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent format across all documents.
- **Headings**: Use clear headings and subheadings to organize content.
- **Bullet Points & Lists**: Use them to present information cleanly.

### **2. Language & Tone**

- **Clear & Concise**: Write directly and avoid jargon unless defined.
- **Active Voice**: Prefer "The team designed the building" over "The building was designed by the team".
- **Inclusive Language**: Avoid gender-specific terms, and be aware of cultural contexts.

### **3. Visuals**

- **Diagrams**: Utilize them to explain complex concepts, especially in design and construction phases.
- **Annotations**: Always label and provide context for visual elements.
- **Consistency**: Use a consistent style and palette for all visuals.

### **4. Version Control**

- **Date Documents**: Ensure every document has a creation and last modified date.
- **Change Log**: Maintain a log for substantial changes, especially for specifications or technical guidelines.

### **5. Review & Feedback**

- **Peer Review**: Every document should be reviewed by at least one other member before finalization.
- **Feedback Loop**: Allow a channel (like comments or a dedicated section) for feedback and questions.

## **Document Templates**

We provide a set of templates for various needs, from design proposals to technical specs. Always start with the appropriate template to ensure consistency.

Remember, the main goal of our documentation standard is to foster clarity, consistency, and collaboration. When in doubt, ask yourself: "Will someone unfamiliar with this project understand this document?"
